# Biometrics
- Refers to the automatic identification of a person based on their physiological or behavioural characteristics.

## Recognition
## Identification
## Verification

## Types
- Physiological
    - Face
    - Fingerprint
    - Hand geometry
    - Iris
    - DNA
- Behavioural
    - Keystroke
    - Signature
    - Voice
## Adv
- Effective technique to enhance security
- User friendly
- Does not use password, PIN or secret code
- Uses physical and behavioural traits for identification and authentication
- Long lasting performance, because traits are permanence
- Difficult to fool biometric sytem

## Dis
- Retina recognition requires closed physical contacts
- Costly
- Voice recognition requires large amount of computer storage, people's voice can change, background noise can interfere.
- Biometric features may change over time
- Signature recognition has poor long term reliability, accuracy difficult to ensure.

## Applications
- ATM, Criminal identification
