## What is Text Mining
- Text mining is the process of transforming unstructured text into structured data for easy analysis.
- It uses NLP to allow machines to understand human language and process it automatically.

## Applications
- Classification
    - Also known as text categorization, is the process of categorizing text into organized groups.
    - Examples: Spam filtering, Sentiment analysis
- Summarization
    - Generating a concise and meaningful summary of text from multiple text resources such as books, news articles, blog posts, research papers, emails, tweets, etc.
    - Examples: The Inshorts app.
- Clustering
    - Automatically group textual documents into clusters based on their content similarity.
    - Examples: Google search engines, Email categorization.
- Information retrieval
    - Finding material of an unstructured nature that satisfies an information need from within large collections using queries.
    - Examples: Search Engines
- Informaton extraction
    - The task of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured and/or semi-structured machine readable documents.
    - Examples: Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction.
- Speech recognition
    - Also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition or speech-to-text is the capability which enables a program to process human speech into a written format.
    - Examples: Google assistant, Bixby, etc.
- Chat bots
    - Examples: Google Assistant, Bixby, Alexa, Cortana, Siri.
- Language translation
    - Examples: Google Translate
- Topic modelling.
    - A type of statistical modelling for discovering the abstract topics that occur in a collection of documents.
    - Examples: Twitter trends, hot topics in news.

## What is text processing
- It refers to the automation of analyzing electronic text.
- It allows machine learning models to get structured information about the text to use for analysis, manipulation of the text, or to generate new text.- It is one of the most common task in manu ML applications.
- Since our interactions with brands have become increasingly online and text-based, text data is one of the most important ways for companies to derive business insights.
- Text data can show how the customers search, but and interact with their brand, products and competitors online.
- Along with machine learning it allows enterprises to handle these large amount of text data.
- Uses: Topic analysis, Sentiment analysis, Intent detection, Language classification, Machine translation, Information retrieval, Information extraction.

## Steps in Text processing
1. Data preprocessing
- Tokenization: Convert sentence to words
- Removing punctuations, tags, etc.
- Removing stop words (frequent words such as 'the', 'is', etc)
- Stemming: Words are reduced to their root word by removing inflection through dropping unnecessary characters, usually a suffix.
- Lemmatization: Removes inflections by determining the part of speech and utilizing detailed database of the language.
2. Feature Extraction
- Breaking down the text into a numerical format that's easily readable by the machine.
- The process of converting text into numeric vectors is called word embedding.
- Word embedding techniques: Bag Of Words (BOW), TF-IDF, Word2Vec.
3. Choosing ML Algorithm
- Using classical ML approaches like 'Naive Bayes' or 'Support Vector Machines' for spam filtering has been widely used.
- Deep learning techniques are giving better results for NLP problems like sentiment analysis and language translation. They are slow to train and for simple text classification problems the give similar results to a classical ML approach which are quicker to train.
