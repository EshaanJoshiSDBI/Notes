- Indexes are the fastest way to find information.
- By default `_id` key is our index.
- Shard key is common in queries for collection. Once defined we can't change it for that particular collection
- Sharding process has 3 main pillars
	+ Config file
	+ Mongosh
	+ MongoD instances
- mongoose are the client connects, MongoD are the services, data stores, etc.
