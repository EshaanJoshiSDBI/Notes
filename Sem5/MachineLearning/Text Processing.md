# Text mining
- Text mining is the process of transforming unstructured textual data into structural information.

## Applications
1. Classification
	1. Classifying text into pre defined classes
	2. Eg: Sentiment analysis, Email filtering
2. Information retrieval
	1. Retrieving data based on a given string
	1. Eg: Search engines
3. Information extraction
	1. Automatically extracting structured information from un/semi structured data.
	1. Eg: Named Entity Recognition (NER). Relation extraction.
2. Text summarization
	1. Summarizing text into a concise and meaningful summary of text from multiple text resources
	2. Eg: Inshorts, Pocket
3. Clustering
	1. Automatically group textual documents into clusters based on their content similarity
	2. Eg: search engines, email categorization, word clouds
3. Chat bots / Virtual Assistant
	1. Google assistant
	2. Bixby
	3. Alexa
	4. Siri
	5. Cortana
6. Topic modelling
	1. Statistical modelling for discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents.
	2. Eg: Twitter trends, Hot topics in news
3. Language translation
	1. Eg: Google translate
2. Speech recognition
	1. Also known as automatic speech recognition, computer speech recognition or speech to text, is a capability which enables a program to process human speech into a written format.
	2. Eg: Google assistant, Bixby, Google meet

## Text processing
- Getting structured information, manipulation of text, generate new text.
- Refers to the automation of analyzing electronic text.
- Since our interactions with brands have become increasingly online and text-based, text data is one of the most important ways for companies to derive business insights.
- Eg: Topic analysis, Sentiment analysis, Intent detection, Language classification.
- Text processing allow businesses to automate processes that provide valuable insights.
- Steps in text processing
1. Data processing
- Lowercasing -> Converting all characters to a lowercase.
- Tokenization: Converting sentences into words
- Removing unnecessary punctuations, tags, etc
- Removing stop workds - frequent words such as 'the', 'is', etc. that do not have specific semantic
- Stemming -> words are reduced to a root by removing inflection through dropping unnecessary characters, usually a suffix.
- Lemmatization -> Another approach to remove inflection by determining the part of speech and utilizing detailed database of the language.
- POS tagging -> (Part Of Speech tagging)
2. Feature extraction

3. Choosing ML algorithms
