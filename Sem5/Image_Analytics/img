# Image Pre-Processing
**Types of Image Pre-Processing techniques**
1. Pixel Brightness transformation


## Gamma Correction
- A non-linear adjustment to individual values

## Sigmoid Stretching
- A continuous non linear activation function
- Function is "S" shaped
- By adjusting the contrast factor and threshold value it is possible to tailor the amount of lightening and darkening to control overall contrast enhancement.

## Geometric Transformations
- Positions of pixels in an image are modified
- Permits elimination of geometric distortion that occurs while image is captured.

## Image filtering and Segmentation
- The goal of using filters is to modify or enhance image properties and / or to extract valuable information from the pictures such as edges, corners and blobs.
- A filter is defined by a kernel, which is a small array applied to each pixel and its neighbors.

# Object Detection
- Object detection is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects.
