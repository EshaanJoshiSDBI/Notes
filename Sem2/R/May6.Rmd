# My current favourite programming is **_Python_**
The formula for water is H~2~O
The formula for area of circle is pie * r ^2^
to display anything to the user we use the print function example: `print('hello')`

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
  print('Hello')
```

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
print(subset(mtcars, mtcars$mpg>20))
```

The package mtcars that I worked with is originally having `r nrow(mtcars)` rows


```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
sys.source('May6.R')
print(stu_db$stu_names)
```
